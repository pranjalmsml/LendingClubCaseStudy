## General Information
- Banks need to identify whom to lend money as there can be borrowers who might not repay the amount.
- Loan.CSV file

## Approach

- Identify all the unnecessary columns and remove them. Remove the outliers and fill null values. This makes data ready for analysis.
- Perform univariate analysis and gathered observations
- Performed segmented univariate analysis of different columns vs loan status to identify which segment has more defaulters.
- Using Bivariate analysis identify the most imapacting columns to get defaulters

## Conclusions

- High interest rate on loans more chances of being defaulters.
- Lower the annual income high chances of being defaulters.
- Higher the group and sub group the defaulters increase.
- Loans given for small scale business purpose have more number of defaulters.
- If the term to repay increases the defaulters also increase
- Loans taken for Debt consolidation and Credit payment have high defaulters
- Borrowers who have previously defaulters are more likely to be defaulters again.
